            Amber Collins-Gebrehiwet was appointed as a Magistrate in the Marion Circuit Court and took the oath of office on December 28th, 2018.
            As a Magistrate, Amber is responsible for presiding over various civil and family law cases.  A native of Indianapolis, 
            Amber received a Bachelor of Science in Public Policy from Northwestern University where she was on the Dean's List.  
            She went on to earn her law degree from Indiana University Maurer School of Law in Bloomington, Indiana.  During law school, 
            she participated in trial team competitions and moot court.  After law school, Amber engaged in private practice before accepting a 
            position in the public service arena as a Deputy Prosecuting Attorney in Marion County.  For over seven years, Amber served as a Deputy Prosecutor, 
            where she successfully represented the State of Indiana in over twenty-five jury trials and a myriad of bench trials and evidentiary hearings.
            <br>
            Amber is an active member of the Marion County Bar Association ("MCBA"), where she served as the Corresponding Secretary from 2012 
            until 2013.  Her participation earned her the distinguished honor of being named to the Board of Directors in 2018 and 2019.  She also 
            spearheaded the creation of an educational program for first-year Black and Latino law students.  This initiative was in collaboration 
            with The Indiana Conference for Legal Education Opportunity ("ICLEO") and consisted of a panel that provided helpful tips about successfully 
            navigating the first year of law school.  Amber is also a member of the Indianapolis Bar Association, where she previously served on the Young 
            Lawyer's Division Career Enhancement Committee and, most recently, the 2020 Bench Bar Committee.
            <br>
            Throughout her legal career, Amber has been committed to helping the community.  She currently sits on the Board of Directors for the Red Cross of Central Indiana and participated on the Outreach Committee.  In past years, as part of her service with the Red Cross of Central Indiana, Amber has taken part in Sound the Alarm, a community service event where volunteers from the Red Cross install smoke alarms in homes in vulnerable areas of central Indiana.  Amber also serves on the Board of Directors for The Irsay Family YMCA, where she sits on the Community Outreach Committee and helps the YMCA spread its message of health and equality to the downtown community.  Amber has been a member of the Sagamore American Inns of Court since 2017.
Over the years, Amber has volunteered extensively with youth-centered organizations, including Reach for Youth's Teen Court.  Currently, she contributes her time to the Center for Leadership and Development.  She is dedicated to teaching and inspiring youth to stay out of trouble and pursue higher education.
